# Audio, Video, Images

## Video and Audio Content

1. In the early days of the web, internet speeds were not fast enough to support video streaming and websites were relient on technologies like Flash to handle video. Now, HTML5 can handle video natively or videos can be hosted on and embedded from other sites such as YouTube.

2. The `src` attribute contains the path to the video's location and the `controls` attribute will activate the browser's native video controls.

3. Fallback content ensures that every user will have some way to access the media, even if their browser does not support the element.

4. A short story.

## A Complete Guide To Grid

1. Grid utilizes a 2-dimaensional flow while flexbox uses a 1-dimensional flow.

2. The grid container is the parent element of all the grid items. Grid items are the elements that are arranged in the grid. Grid lines are the structures that define positions on the grid.

## Responsive Images

1. Responsive images allow different devices to load different resolutions of the same image to improve image quality or load time depending on the device it is being viewed on.

2. The `srcset` attribute provides a list of image filenames and their intrinsic width. The `sizes` attribute defines the conditions that determine which of the image sources will be used.

3. The `srcset` attribute allows you to only load the images want to; if you were to use css or js, you would waste time/data loading all of the images before the css or js decides which one it wants to use.
