# HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

## Using Images In HTML

1. Alt text is useful for when something causes an image to not load, giving a description of what is missing. It also improves accessibility, allowing screen readers to give a description of the image.

2. Use the `alt` attribute to give the image description and avoid using the `title` attribute for content.

3. The `<figure>` element is useful for linking an image or other media to its caption.

4. GIFs are great for simple animation but don't always provide great color reproduction. SVGs are interesting becuase they don't really store the image, but rather instructions on how to draw the image. This means that the image can be reproduced at any size without a loss in quality.

5. For screenshots, PNG is probably the best all-around choice due to its good lossless compression and widespread support.

## Using Color in CSS and  Styling HTML Text Elements

1. The foreground color is the color of the content itself, e.g. the text. The background color is the a solid block of color behind the content, sort of like the canvas that the content is drawn on.

2. Start by selecting a color through association, whether that is with an object or an idea. Then use one of several web tools to help build out a palette that is both visually pleasing and differentiable by people with color blindness.

3. Not all fonts are widely supported on various operating systems, so it is best to choose from the web safe fonts.

4. `font-size` changes how large the text is. `font-weight` changes how bold the text is. `font-style` is used to denote italic text.

5. `line-height` changes the spacing between lines of text. `letter-spacing` changes the distance between letters and `word-spacing` changes the distance between words.
