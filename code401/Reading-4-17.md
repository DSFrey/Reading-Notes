# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

1. S3 is Simple Service Storage, used for storing data in the cloud.

2. Backing up data, running big data analytics, machine learning

3. Very scalable, integrates easily with other AWS products

## [AWS Lambda Basics](https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda)

1. Lambda is a serverless computing service

2. It is most useful when a task is mostly self-contained and there is an inconsistent load.

3. Serverless means you don't have to maintain your own servers, but instead "renting" time on a server farm.

1. A CDN is a content delivery network

2. Multiple servers in different locations store copies of a website's pages. Visitors connect to the closest server.

3. It decreases load on each server as well as latency to the visitor's computer. This also helps protect against DDoS attacks.
