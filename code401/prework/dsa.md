# Data Structures and Algorithms

1. One thing to consider is whether the data will be modified. A linked list is very easy to modify. An array is easy to modify until it runs out of space, at which point it must be moved to a new location, making it much less efficient. A tree may be efficent in looking things up, but inefficient in modifying as it needs to be rearranged to maximize lookup efficiency.

2. A call stack should always have a base case that exits the recursion in addition to the recursive case.
