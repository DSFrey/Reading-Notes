# Component Based UI

## [react hello world](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html)

1. Elements and components

2. Elements describe what you see on the screen. Components are javascript functions that return elements.

3. Components allow you to build responsive pieces of a web app that can be dropped into multiple places.

## [introducing JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

1. JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that helps to describe a UI's appearance. It allows you to separate concerns in your code instead of separating tecnologies.

2. JS expressions are embedded in JSX with curly braces.

3. User input can be safely embedded in JSX as it automatically escapes any embedded values before rendering them.

## [rendering elements](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/rendering-elements.html)

1. A component is a javascript function that accepts inputs (props) and returns an element.

2. React elements are immutable; tey are like a single frame in a video. When the state of a react app is changed, the components affected are executed again to create new elements.

3. When changes are made to the UI, React updates the state.
