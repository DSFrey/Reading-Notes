# Access Control

## [5 steps to RBAC](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3060780/security/5-steps-to-simple-role-based-access-control.html)

1. RBAC assigns access to a system based on the role of the user. This makes it easier to properly give and restrict access to systems based on what each user needs.

2. In a classroom management appication, students and teachers need different permissions to fulfill their responsibilities.

3. A suggested approach for implementing RBAC:

    >1. Inventory your systems
    >2. Analyze your workforce and create roles
    >3. Assign people to roles
    >4. Never make one-off changes
    >5. Audit

## [wiki - RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)

1. Authorization is whether or not you have access to content or controls.

2. >Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:
    >
    >1. Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.
    >2. Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.
    >3. Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized.

3. RBAC assigns access to a system based on the role of the user.

1. Access rights are associated with the role. Users are given roles that determine access so that it doesn't need to be directly determined for each user.

2. Access rights are activated after the user authenticates themselves.

3. Access policies do not need to change when users change; the users are simply assigned different roles. It also makes it easier to control access to only what the user needs.
