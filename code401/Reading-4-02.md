# Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

## An introduction to NodeJS and Express

1. Middleware is software that that works between the operating system and an application, providing services beyond the base level of the OS.

2. Express is te most popular Node web framework.

3. Express is unopinionated, meaning it does not ave many restrictions on what components and middleware can be used and how they are used together.

4. A module is a javascript file or library that can be imported into other code. Building applications this way makes it easier to organize, maintain, and update code.

## What is NPM?

1. I am running npm version 8.19.1

2. `npm i jshint`

## What is TDD?

1. Tests are important because they provide a simple, controlled way to check if all pieces of your code are working.

2. Three benefits to testing:

    1. Reduction in defect rates.

    2. Reduction in effort for final project phase.

    3. Anecdotally, an improvement in code design quality.

3. Individual pitfalls include writing tests that are not specific enough or only check trivial things. Team pitfalls include poor maintenance of the test suite, resulting in poor optimization, or abandoning the testing entirely.

## CI/CD

1. Continuous integration helps to ensure everyone's code will fit together, helps to catch bugs, and reduces merge conflicts.

2. Continuous Delivery is the practice of developing software in such a way that you could release at any time. Continuous deployment is actually releasing features as they are developed.

3. Gitub can act as a go-between, letting your deployment servers know that a new version of the software is available and letting the developer know that the deployment passed all checks and is good to go.
