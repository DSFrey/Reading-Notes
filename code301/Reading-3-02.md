# State and Props

## React lifecycle

1. Render happens before componentDidMount.

2. The first stage of the React life cycle is the constructor.

3. constructor, render, React Updates, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount

4. componentDidMount executes its contained code after the component has mounted; this is the best place for network requests or interacting with DOM.

## React State Vs Props

1. Anything that you want to initialize in a displayed component, e.g. a title or description.

2. Props are passed to a component while state is handled inside a component.

3. The application is re-rendered when state changes.

4. State stores things that can be updated by the user, e.g. form inputs.
