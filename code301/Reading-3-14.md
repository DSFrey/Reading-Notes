# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. The proportion of women in computer science fell in the mid 80s when computers became more common in homes and were primarily marketed to boys.

2. In computer science classes, professors assumed that students would have experience with computers, which was more common with boys than girls.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders.

2. "Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it."

3. When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.
