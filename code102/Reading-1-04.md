## Wireframing

Wireframing is a process used to design the interface of a website or app before any code is written. Having a good wireframe will improve the user experience more than any colors, typefaces or the like will ever be able to. Additionally, it is much easier (and thus, cheaper) to make changes at the wireframing stage, so testing your product at the wireframing stage will improve development efficiency and final quality.

### Wireframing Process

1. **Do Your Research:** Determine audience, requirements, use cases, etc. before you start designing anything.
2. **Prepare Your Research:** Organize you research findings to put them in context and make them easer to reference.
3. **Map Out User Flow:** Figure out the path that you expect your users to take through the product.
4. **Sketch:** Start drawing some ideas, but don't try to add to much detail.
5. **Start Testing:** Start filling in details and get feedback from teammates or consumers to improve your design.
6. **Start Prototyping:** Now is the time to turn your wireframe into a prototype. Nice!

## HTML

HTML is based around elements that contain content surrounded by tags that describe what the content is and how it should behave. A tag may include an attribute, separated from the tag definition by a space.

## Semantics

Working with semantics in coding is asking the question "What is the purpose of this element?" rather that just "What does the output look like?" For example, coding with good semantic value would lead you to use `<h1>` to denote your header rather than using styling to make the element look like a header. This guideline makes it easier for everyone who interacts with code, from search engines to accessability programs to other developers (or even yourself).
