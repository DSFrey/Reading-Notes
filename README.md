## Growth Mindset

### Description

A growth mindset acknowledges that humans are mutable; our knowledge and abilities are always changing. Where a fixed mindset treats claims that new skills cannot be developed and any effort towards doing so will simply be wasted, a growth mindset encourages trying new things and pushing yourself towards higher goals

### Strategies

1. **Perservere:** Accept that things may not work immediately. It takes effort to grow.

3. **Explore:** use other people's creativity to encourage your own.
4. **Reflect** When you learn something new, take a moment to step back and place that knowledge in a broader landscape.
