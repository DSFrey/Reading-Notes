# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## HTML: Creating Hyperlinks

1. Basic links are created by wrapping content in a `<a>` or anchor element.

2. The `href` attribute contains the hypertext reference or url of the target.

3. Make the link text descriptive of what is being linked and do not use the url in the link text. Avoid using the same link text for multiple links on the same page.

## CSS Layout: Normal Flow and Positioning

1. Normal flow is the way a page is laid out before any changes are made by css.

2. Block-level elements expand to fill the horizontal space of its parent element, while inline elements only take up as much horizontal space as the element's content. Block-level elements appear on a new line below the last block-level element. Inline elements just continue on the line of text that they are contained in.

3. Static positioning is the default for all html elements.

4. Absolute positioning takes an element out of the normal flow of the document and is placed in its own layer in the closest ancestor element that has been positioned. This means that it's position is not affected by any other sibling elements, nor does its position affect other sibling elements.

5. Absolute positioning places elements in relation to the closest ancestor element that has been positioned. Fixed positioning places elements in relation to the viewport.

## JS Functions: Reusable Blocks of Code

1. Declaration is defining what a function will do. Invocation is actually calling and executing the function.

2. Parameters are the names listed when the function is declared. Arguments are the actual values being used when the function is invoked.

## Reasons for Pair Programming

Pair programming can be more efficient than coding by yourself. While the actual writing will take slightly longer, having two people means that there are two people coming up with solutions when a problem prevents progress and more mistakes are caught in the initial writing so less troubleshooting is needed later on.

Many companies use pair programming in interviews or in on-the-job training, so having experience with the practice will have a direct benefit as a professional in the marketplace.
