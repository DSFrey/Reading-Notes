# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

## Introduction to HTML

1. Using semantic tags makes it much easier for developers, search engines, and accessibility tools to read what the html is actually doing. It also helps make clear associations with other files, e.g. your CSS stylesheet.

2. There are 6 levels of heading tags. There should be just one `<h1>` per page and sub-headings should increment in order one level at a time.

3. The `<sub>` and `<sup>` elements are frequently used in math and science to write things such as H<sub>2</sub>O or x<sup>2</sup>.

4. The `title` attribute is added to a `<abbr>` tag to provide the expansion for the term.

## Learn CSS

1. CSS can be applied to a document in 3 ways.

    1. **Inline styles:** Adding an attribute to a tag that affects only the contents of that element. This is inefficient, messy, and generally frowned upon.

    2. **Internal Stylesheet:** Added in a `<style>` element in the `<head>`. This is cleaner than inline styles, but still inefficient if your site has more than one page.

    3. **External Stylesheet:** Contained in a separate file and referenced in a `<link>` element in the `<head>`.

2. It is much harder to read both the HTML and CSS if they are mixed together. Also editing CSS is much easier if it is all in one place instead of scattered over multiple lines in multiple pages.

3. |Component|Example|
    |---|---|
    |Selector|`h2`|
    |Declaration|`color: black;`|
    ||`padding: 5px;`|
    |Property|`color`|
    ||`padding`|
    |Value|`black`|
    ||`5px`|

## Learn JS

### JS Basics

1. A String

2. |Operator|Effect|
    |---|---|
    |`+`|Add two numbers or concatenate two strings|
    |`=`|Assign value to variable|
    |`===`|Compare two variables; returns true if they are the same type and same value|
    |`!`|Negates the following expression or operator|

3. You could take a list of variables and put them in an array.

### Making Decisions In Your Code â€“ Conditionals

1. An `if` statement checks a condition and if it evaluates to `true`, then the code block will execute.

2. An `else if` statement is used when there are more than two outcomes we want to test for.

3. `===` and `!==` test if a value is identical or not identical to another value. `<` and `>` test if one value is greater than or less than another value.

4. `&&` is the logical AND operator; it returns `true` only if both operands are `true`. The logical OR operator `||` only requires that one of the two operands is `true`.
