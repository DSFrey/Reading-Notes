# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. >He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet

2. Most interactions used to be direct, but we need a way to get information from one machine about resources on another machine.

3. HTTP provides a unified language for performing actions with resources on another machine.

4. `GET` retrieves content from the server.

5. `POST` adds content to another system.

6. `PUT` replaces specified content in another system.

7. `Patch` partially updates content's state
