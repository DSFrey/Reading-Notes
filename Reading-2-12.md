# Chart.js, Canvas

## JavaScript Canvas

1. The `<canvas>` element allows a developer to create 2D graphics using JavaScript.

2. The `<canvas>` element has a closing tag, as the content contained within is fallback content. Also, I believe it is the only content that screen readers can access?

3. `getContext()` sets what kind of drawing will be rendered on the `<canvas>`, e.g. 2D or webgl.
