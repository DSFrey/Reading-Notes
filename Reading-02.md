### Text Editors

There are many text editors that can do the job well, so ultimately, the choice comes down to personal preference. There are, however some important features to consider.

1. **Code completion:** suggestions based on what you have typed can speed up entry and help prevent typos or missing elements.
2. **Syntax highlighting:** Different parts of the code are different colors depending on their funtion, making it easier to quickly parse.
3. **Themes:** Being able to adjust the colors of background and text provides opportunity for personalization or, more importantly, reducing eyestrain.
4. **Extensions:** Ways to add more functionality to your editor.

Related to text editors is the IDE, or Integrated Devlopment Environment. These programs include a text editor, file manager, compiler, and a debugger in one package.
