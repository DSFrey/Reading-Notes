## Text Editors

There are many text editors that can do the job well, so ultimately, the choice comes down to personal preference. There are, however some important features to consider.

1. **Code completion:** suggestions based on what you have typed can speed up entry and help prevent typos or missing elements.
2. **Syntax highlighting:** Different parts of the code are different colors depending on their funtion, making it easier to quickly parse.
3. **Themes:** Being able to adjust the colors of background and text provides opportunity for personalization or, more importantly, reducing eyestrain.
4. **Extensions:** Ways to add more functionality to your editor.

Related to text editors is the IDE, or Integrated Devlopment Environment. These programs include a text editor, file manager, compiler, and a debugger in one package.

## The Command Line

The command line or terminal allows a user to interface with the system bypassing the GUI. When interacting with the terminal, the first thing you write is the command. This can be followed by a number of arguments (each separated by a space) that will modify the the command given. Options are a specific type of argument that are listed before other arguments and denoted by an initial hyphen.

Some basic commands include:

- pwd: stands for print working directory, showing you where in your computer you are right now.
- ls: lists the contents of your current location. The option "-l" shows information about each piece of content. You can also give a path to another directory to display instead of the working directory.
- cd: stand for change directory, allowing you to navigate around in your computer.

Paths to locations can be described in several different ways.

- Absolute: Begins with a slash and describes the whole path from your home directory
- Relative: Does not begin with a slash and describes a directory within your current location
- "~": A shortcut to your home directory.
- ".": The current directory.
- "..": The parent directory.

Pressing the TAB key while typing a path will auto complete it, or if there are multiple options will let you cycle through them.
