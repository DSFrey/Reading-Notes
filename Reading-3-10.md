## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

1. A call is a function invocation.

2. Only one call can happen at a time (it is single-threaded).

3. Last in, First out

4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

5. A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function without an exit point. The browser can only track a certain number of stack calls before it throws a stack error.

## JavaScript error messages

1. A reference error is when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared.

2. A syntax error is when improper syntax prevents the code from compiling.

3. A range error is when you try to manipulate a length and give it an invalid number.

4. I don't know what a tyep error is, but a type error is when you try to use a value of the wrong type, e.g. trying to access object prototype methods for something that is not an object.

5. A marker indicating that execution of the code should stop so that you can observe the code's state at that point.

6. It pauses the code and allows you to step through line by line.
