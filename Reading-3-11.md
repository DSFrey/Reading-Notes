# Mongo and Mongoose

## nosql vs sql

1. |SQL|NoSQL|
    |---|---|
    |relational|distributed|
    |table-based|document, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
    |standardized schema|dynamic schema|
    |vertically scalable|horizontally scalable|
    |use structured query language|variable syntax

2. SQL is good for complex queries and heavy duty transactional type applications.

3. Financial institutions

4. NoSQL is good for heirarchical data storage and large data sets

5. good for Big Data

6. For heirarchical data use NoSQL

7. Both are scalable but in different ways. NoSQL is probably easier to scale.

1. Structured Query Language

2. A database that uses multiple related tables to store information

3. relational databases work with tables

4. schema describes what data can go into a table

5. A database that does not use SQL

6. stores data in a heirarchy with dynamic schema

7. a tree of key-value pairs

8. MongoDB is more flexible

9. A lack of relations--data must be stored in multiple places
